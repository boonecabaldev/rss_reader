   <p>
    Thanks to this this blog I found J.S. Savage‘s debut and it is a gem. The Mystery of Treefall Manor is the first Inspector Graves mystery and I hope that many will follow. We are in 1926, in the UK. The prologue starts strong. A maid, Jayne Brown, demands to see wealthy, successful business man, landowner, and […]
