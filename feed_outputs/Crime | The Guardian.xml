   <p>
    The coronavirus pandemic had a huge effect on the justice system, but what else can the data show us?
   </p>
   <p>
    “Justice delayed is justice denied” goes the old legal maxim – one that has captured the state of the court system in England and Wales in recent years.
   </p>
   <p>
    The backlogs caused by the coronavirus pandemic are only one of the ways in which the justice and policing system has changed over the last 14 years – from cuts to legal aid and policing, to a more positive story on crime levels, much has changed since 2010.

    High streets across the UK are struggling with an epidemic of stealing. What’s behind this sudden crime wave and can anything be done to stop it?
   </p>
   <p>
    A man leaves a north London branch of Aldi carrying two bags of groceries that he did not pay for. He hadn’t planned to steal, but after becoming exasperated with the slowness of staff attending to the various glitches and alarms of the self-checkout system, and assuming it would go unnoticed, decides to just walk out the door.
   </p>
   <p>
    He crosses the road and heads towards home. It’s a busy part of town and this kind of thing happens all the time. He doubts anyone in the store even noticed. But a voice calls after him, a security guard has given chase. The man, slightly panicked, doubles down and quickens his pace, pretending not to hear, but the guard keeps shouting, pleading for him to stop. In an attempt to lose his pursuer, the man ducks into a newsagent. The security guard enters, finds the man pretending to browse the fountain pens, and challenges him. “Sir, you didn’t pay for that shopping.”

    This remarkable documentary goes behind the scenes at a new major crime unit digging into dormant cases – and getting closure for brave survivors who’ve been waiting for decades

   <p>
    Cold Case Investigations: Solving Britain’s Sex Crimes initially appears to be yet another behind-the-scenes documentary about police work in the UK, along the lines of

    </a>
    , The Met and so on. But this stands out because the investigations covered in these two episodes are historic crimes, which have been unsolved for between 20 and 40 years, and because its focus is on sexual offences. The sensitivity this requires is evident; the stories are told carefully, with respect for the victims and for the officers meticulously reassembling what is often complex historical evidence and applying new techniques to it.
