  <description>
   The following is us talking about the recent abuse of the privacy complaint and DMCA system here on YouTube. One user has been allowed to repeatedly file privacy complaints with no real consequence in the hopes that content critical of their behavior will be mistakenly removed. 

My previous videos would not of been possible with out some amazing people. 
- @Spinnling 
- Parentiegon 
- @LazyBedhead 
- @Slimebeast 

Ask me anything, direct donos are appriciated. Also we got Members now! Plagued Moth filed some complaints against the channel and I wanted to let some other people speak about their stories that did not make it into the video. My previous live stream will be removed after this one.

   Why Plagued Moth Needs To STOP!
  </title>
  <link>
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbpcX4A7jxA
  </link>
  <description>
   The following is a response to Plagued Moth and the many accusations has levied at me and my friends. Moth is so wrong that its not even funny, and despite his attempts to deplatform me the only one who lost their platform is the monster throwing out damaging claims with no evidence. I also go over what I did wrong, and how in future I wanna be better... however it has nothing to do with any of the garbage Moth throws my way. 

Plagued Moth is a danger to our community. Thats my opinion.

This video would not be possible without  @Spinnling  @LazyBedhead  @TheChrisLotus   and Perentiegon. They kept my head on straight, and gave me the tools I needed to prove I was not a liar. Thank you!

Evidence Drive - Due to a privacy complaint from Plagued Moth, we cannot offer this drive. He does not want you to see it. If you wish for a link to the evidence used in this video feel free to reach out to me on twitter @ CreepyReading

   The following video is about a creator that would easily make the Worst YouTuber lists and someone I worked with in the past. While I personally don't believe that he is continuing this behavior, I think its pretty messed up that he lied. Its messed up but I can't come up with any other explaination.
