     55 Years Later, Pearle Bartley's Murder is still Unsolved

      According to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE), there are at least 350,000 unsolved murders in America. In Florida, 20,000 cases have gone cold. Florida's clearance rate on murders is the national average, about 66%, meaning one-third of murders in the state are still open. I find those numbers staggering. How many killers live among us? In 1969, a 72-year-old store owner met a gruesome death in a historic central Florida town. There isn't a great deal of information about the case, but here's what is known.

    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     Micanopy, named after a Seminole chieftain, was founded in 1821. It is the oldest inland town in the state. During the Seminole Indian wars, many residents holed up in Fort Defiance, located near the town. In 1836, Seminole chief Osceola unsuccessfully attacked the fort. After a battle lasting a little more than an hour, Osceola retreated. More soldiers in Fort Defiance died of malaria than fighting Indians. Major J. F. Hieleman, who led the counter-attack on Osceola, perished from the disease a few days after the battle.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     In 1969, Micanopy had a population of about 750.
     <b>
      Pearle Bartley
     </b>
     , born in 1897, owned a small general store there. Called "Pearle's Place," she resided alone in a home attached to the store. On October 29, two customers walked into the business and found her lying on the floor. She'd been strangled to death and money was missing from the cash drawer.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     Pearle's granddaughter, Marci Buchanan, said, "She was a very caring, gentle, docile person. She would have given anybody anything. So it just really shocked our family she was murdered like that." Marci remembers Pearle playing the "Missouri Waltz" on the piano. She told reporters her grandmother taught her to "tend a garden and crochet."

    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     Micanopy lies about 12 miles south of Gainesville and 26 miles north of Ocala. Today it still has a population of less than 1,000. Canopied by hundreds of huge oak trees, the village is known for its eclectic mix of stores that sell vintage books, art, crafts, rare jewelry, music, and antiques. Many of the businesses are located in 19th century-era buildings (
     <i>

     </i>
     ). The town has no police force, so the Alachua County Sheriff's Office investigates any major criminal activity in the area.

    <span style="font-size: medium;">
     After the murder, Alachua County homicide investigator Kevin Allen said deputies set up roadblocks to question drivers coming into or going out of Micanopy. While canvassing the area, many residents had noticed "that there was a blue or black motorcycle at or around the scene at the time of the homicide." No local citizen was known to own such a motorcycle.
    </span>
   </span>
   <p/>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     Decades after the murder, two suspects emerged. Georgia serial killer
     <b>
      Carlton Gary
     </b>
     (
     <i>
      pictured below
     </i>
     ) resided in Gainesville at the time of the murder. Pearle fit the killer's profile--he enjoyed strangling elderly white women to death while raping them. (Investigators have never said whether Pearle was sexually assaulted.)

    </a>
   </div>
   <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
    A fingerprint found at the crime scene did not match Gary. Detective Allen spoke with Gary while he was on death row and said "he made admissions to almost every crime he had committed including robberies and burglaries, but he said he was not involved with any sexual murders of elderly females in Georgia or the state of Florida." On March 15, 2018, the killer was executed for the rapes and murders of three women in Georgia.
   </span>
   <p/>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     The fingerprint had been lifted off a Coca Cola cooler that sat near the body of Pearle. It came back to a "hustler and con-man" named
     <b>
      Austin Felker
     </b>
     . According to Allen, Felker had recently moved to Florida and "was the new owner of a blue and black motorcycle." But he had no history of violence. Was he the killer or just a customer? It's likely no one will ever know since he died many years ago.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     The murder of Pearle Bartley is still being investigated. It speaks highly of Detective Allen and others who won't let the coldest of cases rest.

      A few minutes after the 9-1-1 call, two officers from the Raleigh Police Department arrived.

    <div>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      <br/>
      Jim Sughrue, spokesman for the police department, described the scene to reporters. “As [police] investigated the area,” he said, “they located a female behind the building who is a homicide victim.” Robbery seemed an unlikely motive since Jenna Nielsen’s purse and other personal belongings were found in the vehicle. The victim’s pants had been pulled down to her knees, causing investigators to theorize that she may have been murdered while fighting off a sexual attack.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      When she died, Jenna was eight-and-a-half months pregnant with a boy already named Ethen. Married and the mother of two boys, Jenna had been going about her job restocking newspaper boxes for
      <i>
       USA Today
      </i>
      . Her husband, Tim, worked during the day and kept the children at night while his wife delivered papers.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      An autopsy revealed a single stab wound to the neck. Only three inches deep, it had slashed her carotid artery and jugular vein, causing her to bleed to death. There were abrasions on Jenna’s arms and legs, as if she’d been dragged or had fallen. The autopsy also showed that Ethen was 39-40 weeks old, weighed 6.35 pounds, and was 19.9 inches long. He was healthy and normal in every way.

     </span>
    </div>
    <div>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      Even though he would have been delivered within a few days, at the time, North Carolina had no fetal victim law that would allow for the conviction of Ethen's killer.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      After detectives interviewed area residents and business owners, they released a sketch of a “person of interest” (
      <i>

      ) who had been seen in the area near the time of the murder. According to police, that neighborhood is usually deserted at four-forty-five in the morning.

      From the start, leads were few. It seemed to be a random attack, possibly committed by a sexual predator. The double murder made national headlines for a few weeks, and
      <i>
       America's Most Wanted
      </i>
      , a popular true crime show, picked up the case.
      <i>
       USA Today
      </i>
      published ads calling for information about the case.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      As the investigation continued, the family released a statement to the press. “Jenna was a loving mother, wife and daughter,” the statement said. “She had a very outgoing personality, [and] was everyone’s friend. Jenna and her Husband Tim had 2 wonderful sons: Schyler, 3, and Kaiden, 11 months. They were expecting their third son Ethen on July 8th. Jenna’s family recently relocated to the area from Utah when her father and husband’s jobs were relocated. She enjoyed living in the Raleigh area for the warm weather and the friendly people. She fit right in.”
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Seventeen years later, the family is still waiting for an arrest. The news crews are long-gone, and stories about their beloved wife and daughter only seem to come on anniversaries of Jenna's murder.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The family has a website,
      <a href="http://justice4jenna.weebly.com/">
       justice4jenna
      </a>
      .
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Tim and Jenna's father, Kevin Blaine, worked to pass the Unborn Victims of Violence Act in North Carolina. The law, enacted in 2011, reads: “AN ACT TO PROVIDE THAT A PERSON WHO commits the crime of murder or manslaughter OF A PREGNANT WOMAN is GUILTY OF A SEPARATE OFFENSE for THE RESULTING DEATH OF THE unborn child and to provide that a person who commits a felony or a misdemeanor that is an act of domestic violence and injures a pregnant woman that results in a miscarriage or stillbirth by the woman is guilty of a separate offense that is punishable at the same class and level as the underlying offense.”

     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      The day after Jenna's murder, someone discovered a bloody knife discarded near a sidewalk not far from the crime scene. Police quickly confiscated the weapon, but remained tight-lipped on its significance to the case. Investigators also found a single human hair in Jenna's hand. Other items collected from the scene were a broken earring, a flip-flop, two shirts, bloodstains, cigarette butts, and a broken red vehicle light lens. Whether any of those items belonged to the killer remains to be seen.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Investigators are still searching for the person of interest noticed by a witness in the area of the murder. The suspect was thought to be in his late teens or early twenties and is about five-feet-three-inches tall, weighing 120 pounds. Police said he may be Hispanic. At the time of the murder, he wore a dark-colored sleeveless shirt and baggy denim shorts. His most noticeable characteristic was black hair pulled into a long pony-tail.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Police have one major clue that could lead to the killer’s capture. Family members informed reporters that police have DNA thought to be from the killer. Investigators continue to run the sample through CODIS, the FBI's national database that contains profiles of convicted offenders. So far, they have not gotten a match.

     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      Meanwhile, a murderer, unless he's in prison for another crime or dead, lives and breathes free air. Justice waits to be served.

      <span style="font-size: medium;">
       In the dead of night, on March 3, 1964, a rickety 22-foot-long fishing boat called the
       <i>
        Delfin
       </i>
       moved slowly off a beach near Santiago de Cuba. Equipped only with an antique outboard motor and sails made from flour sacks, eighteen men, women and children crowded its decks. They were bound for Jamaica, 140 miles away. From there, they knew they could obtain visas to freedom (i.e., the United States of America).
      </span>
     </div>
     <div>
      <span style="font-size: medium;">
       <br/>
      </span>
     </div>
     <div>
      <span style="font-size: medium;">
       If caught by patrolling Cuban gunboats or Russian helicopters, they would be machine-gunned. But they decided freedom was worth the risk.
      </span>
     </div>
     <div>
      <span style="font-size: medium;">
       <br/>
      </span>
     </div>
     <div>
      <span style="font-size: medium;">
       After working for many years as a salesman, Vicente Mayans saved up enough money to purchase the
       <i>
        Delfin.
       </i>
       When friends and neighbors learned of his plan to flee, many asked to join. Mayans later said he couldn't turn them down. Thinking the trip would take two days, they stocked up with only six cans of ham and ten gallons of water.
      </span>
     </div>
     <div>
      <span style="font-size: medium;">
       <br/>
      </span>
     </div>
     <div>
      <span style="font-size: medium;">
       Almost immediately, things went wrong. First, the motor quit. A mechanic named Alberto spent 24 hours attempting to repair it, but to no avail. Next, heavy winds blew down the flimsy mast. Now the boat was at the mercy of the ocean currents. And soon their food and water ran out.
      </span>
     </div>
     <div>
      <span style="font-size: medium;">
       <br/>
      </span>
     </div>
     <div>
      <span style="font-size: medium;">
       Mayans later told Ian Glass, a reporter for the
       <i>
        Miami News
       </i>
       , "We became hopelessly lost." The boat began drifting, first in one direction, then another. Vicente's pretty wife, Digna, had joined him in their quest for freedom but now it seemed they both might die.
      </span>
     </div>
     <div>
      <span style="font-size: medium;">
       <br/>
      </span>
     </div>
     <div>
      <span style="font-size: medium;">
       It never rained. The sun beat down all day every day. They tried fishing, using a few crumbs of bread for bait.Luis, a former hotel worker, landed a small shark. "We tore it apart with our hands like animals," Mayans said. "We ate it raw."
      </span>
     </div>
     <div>
      <span style="font-size: medium;">
       <br/>
      </span>
     </div>
     <div>
      <span style="font-size: medium;">
       The refugees tried to row, but the current was too strong.As the boat floated aimlessly through heavy seas, some began slowly losing their minds. Two men jumped into the water and were never seen again. Starving, dehydrated, sunken-eyed and so thin they looked like skeletons, one-by-one the freedom-seekers dropped dead on the deck. Many died clutching their rosaries.
      </span>
     </div>
     <div>
      <span style="font-size: medium;">
       <br/>
      </span>
     </div>
     <div>
      <span style="font-size: medium;">
       Mayans said, "Death came almost quietly. They would just lie down in the boat to conserve strength and assumed when they woke up we would have been rescued. But they never woke up." A trail of vicious sharks, smelling death, followed the boat. Mayans and his fellow Cubans reluctantly pushed corpses over the edge and watched the sharks fight for the bodies.
      </span>
     </div>
     <div>
      <span style="font-size: medium;">
       <br/>
      </span>
     </div>
     <div>
      <span style="font-size: medium;">
       Day after day, the sad boat drifted.
      </span>
     </div>
     <div>
      <span style="font-size: medium;">
       <br/>
      </span>
     </div>
     <div>
      <span style="font-size: medium;">
       Mayans recounted, "Soon there was only Digna and me. And then she, too, died. One minute she was asleep, and the next..." Unwilling to throw his beloved wife to the sharks, he held her and vowed they would die together.
      </span>
     </div>
     <div>
      <span style="font-size: medium;">
       <br/>
      </span>
     </div>
     <div>
      <span style="font-size: medium;">
       After seventeen days, the boat washed up on the shores of Grand Cayman, one of a group of British-owned islands. Beachgoers found the sole survivor, Vicente Mayans.
      </span>
     </div>
     <div>

      <span style="font-size: medium;">
       He was hospitalized for nearly a week, then finally made it to the United States. He spent many years working to commemorate lost freedom-seekers from Cuba.
      </span>

     <div>
      <span style="font-size: medium;">

      </span>
     </div>
     <div>
      <span style="font-size: medium;">
       The Straits of Florida, called the "Death Corridor," lies between Cuba and Florida. For Cubans, the 92 miles of ocean has remained a watery gauntlet to be sailed through. Refugees face hurricanes, Cuban militia patrols, man-hungry sharks, exposure to scorching weather, high seas and rogue waves, the loneliness of the open ocean, and other deadly obstacles to reach freedom.
      </span>
     </div>
     <div>
      <div>
       <span style="font-size: medium;">
        <br/>
       </span>
      </div>
      <div>
       <span style="font-size: medium;">
        Perhaps Vicente Mayans said it best. Cuban refugees "are quiet martyrs who are testimony to the hell that Cuba must be, if they are willing to give up their lives rather than live there."

    For nearly a hundred years, the one-room log cabin sat high up in the Continental Divide, seven miles above Butte, Montana. It weathered blizzards and freezing weather each winter, and summer thunderstorms that rocked the landscape with killer bolts of lightning.
   </span>
   <div>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     <br/>
    </span>
   </div>
   <div>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     In 1957, seventy-six-year-old John Maxwell called the cabin home.
    </span>
    <div>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      <br/>
     </span>
    </div>
    <div>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      The
      <i>
       Montana Standard
      </i>
      reported that "at the age of 26 [he] was employed by the Corry Consolidated Mining Co., as a stationary engineer and later in charge of mining operations." Many years later, when the gold and silver "played out," the company hired Maxwell to remain there as caretaker. During those decades alone on the mountain, he enjoyed prospecting, occasionally finding a nugget or two missed by the mining company.
     </span>
    </div>
    <div>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      <br/>
     </span>
    </div>
    <div>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      But Maxwell was no miser. He made monthly trips down steep, dangerous mountain trails to resupply and meet with friends. The
      <i>
       Standard
      </i>
      said his modest cabin "was a haven for hikers, skiers, and Boy Scouts out on an adventure. Everyone passing by received a warm welcome and most returned again and again to visit with the friendly prospector."
     </span>
    </div>
    <div>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      <br/>
     </span>
    </div>
    <div>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      On August 7, Curley Robbins, a forest ranger, saw smoke rising near Maxwell's cabin. While checking to find the exact location of the fire, he stopped by to see if his prospector friend could direct him to the source. As he entered the cabin, Robbins encountered a gruesome sight. Maxwell lay near his bed, severely beaten and shot twice.
     </span>
    </div>
    <div>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      <br/>
     </span>
    </div>
    <div>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      When Jefferson County Sheriff George Paradis and Coroner Kyle Scott arrived at the scene, the place was neat and orderly. They found no sign of ransacking, or any other clue to provide a reason for the violence inflicted on the old man. Maxwell's own gun, an old Colt Peacemaker, "a 38-40 caliber revolver" he had brought home after serving in the Spanish-American War, was the murder weapon.
     </span>
    </div>
    <div>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      <br/>
     </span>
    </div>
    <div>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      Maxwell's eyes were swollen shut from heavy blows, and two of his teeth had been knocked out. Paradis found them on the bed. Coroner Scott said "the slug that killed Maxwell entered the back near the left shoulder blade, coursed through the body, and emerged near the groin. The bullet was found embedded in the cabin's wooden floor..." It's possible that Maxwell had been sleeping when attacked.
     </span>
    </div>
    <div>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      <br/>
     </span>
    </div>
    <div>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      The neatness of the cabin surprised the sheriff. A bookcase held many well-worn editions, such as the complete works of Dickens,
      <i>
       The Life of Napoleon Bonaparte
      </i>
      ,
      <i>
       The Plattsburg Manual
      </i>
      , and hundreds more. A transistor radio sat beside Maxwell's bed. Friends said he could sometimes pick up music stations at night.
     </span>
    </div>
    <div>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      <br/>
     </span>
    </div>
    <div>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      Maxwell's body was taken down the mountain to the Scott Funeral Home in Whitehall. A few days later, staff transported him to the Masonic Temple in Butte where services were held. His remains were then shipped to his hometown of Portland, Oregon for burial.
     </span>

      Although the sheriff put a lot of effort into solving the case, there seemed to be no viable clues to follow. In addition to the bullet that killed him, a second round hit him in the back and exited his shoulder. But cops never found the old man's gun.

      reported that "lawmen rummaged inch-by-inch through Maxwell's cabin Friday night. They found a bullet embedded in the cabin's wooden floor near a large, iron-posted bed and was found about five feet from Maxwell's body." The sheriff interviewed everyone known to be in the area at the time of the murder, but all were cleared.

     A Twist of Fate

    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     On April 16, 1960, a mild spring day in middle Tennessee, a seventeen-year-old girl walked toward the Duck River (
     <i>
      pictured below
     </i>
     ) carrying a fishing rod and a can of worms. Given the nice weather, fish should be biting, she thought. Bass, perch, catfish, maybe even a rainbow trout might be tempted by her bait. But while fishing would be fun, she had confided to friends her real motive was to get a suntan.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-size: medium;">
     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      In a twist of fate, her brother had planned to drive her to the river, but the family's car wouldn't start. So the shy country girl decided to hike the four miles to the river.
     </span>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-size: medium;">
     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      She never returned home. Late that afternoon, her mother reported her missing. As the investigation began, three residents who knew the girl reported seeing her walking toward the river. They told investigators she wore red shorts and carried a rod and reel.
     </span>
    </span>

   <p>
    <span style="font-size: medium;">

       "Searchers beat through miles of rugged backwoods near here yesterday," the
       <i>
        Nashville Tennessean

       reported, "without finding a trace of a pretty blonde teenage girl who vanished Wednesday. More than 50 persons searched on the ground and from the air for

     Coffee County Sheriff Dan Daniel seemed perplexed. "You can't help but think there was foul play," he said. "You look at it any way you want to, and you come up with the same thing." In addition to the sheriff's department, the Tennessee Bureau of Criminal Identification joined the search.
    </span>
   </span>
   <p/>
   <p>
    <span style="font-size: medium;">
     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      The area Anna walked was sparsely populated. A few houses lay scattered along the road, but as it neared the river, craggy outcrops appeared in the heavily forested terrain.
     </span>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-size: medium;">
     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      According to friends, Anna seemed happy one day and depressed the next.
     </span>
     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      A few days before, she'd broken up with her boyfriend. Then she decided to quit school. Friends told cops she could be "moody" at times.
     </span>
     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      Years later, someone would coin the term
     </span>
     <i style="font-family: georgia;">
      teenage angst
     </i>
     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      , but in the early 1960s, her attitude seemed relatively normal.
     </span>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     Anna's father, Harold Kelnhofer, employed by the U. S. army corps of engineers in Seattle, Washington, was said to be flying back home to join the hunt.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     For two days, the search continued. In frustration, Daniels called in the Tullahoma National Guard, the Civil Air Patrol, boy scouts, and dozens of volunteers.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     <b>
      The Rod and Reel
     </b>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     On the second day of the search, Fred Hickerson, of Tullahoma, a city of 12,000, reported to police that
     <b>
      Arthur
     </b>
     <b>
      Roger Ivey
     </b>
     , a local insurance salesman, had given him a rod and reel. Detectives soon determined it was the same one Anna had carried. Hickerson said Ivey had first attempted to sell it for $2.00 at a pawn shop, but was unsuccessful.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     Cops quickly descended on Ivey.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-size: medium;">
     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      As they interrogated the suspect, he quickly broke. The
      <i>
       Tennessean
      </i>
      reported that "Ivey said he hit the girl accidentally, then panicked, piled her body into the trunk
     </span>
     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      of his car, and drove to the old military reservation." (Camp Forrest, one of the army's largest military bases during World War II, had long been abandoned and was now undergoing new forest growth.) Investigators went to the location where Ivey said he ran into the girl, but saw no skid marks or disturbances on or near the road. In addition, they found no damage to Ivey's vehicle.
     </span>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     Ivey led cops to Camp Forrest, eight miles from Tullahoma. There he pointed out the gravesite where he buried the girl. She lay in a shallow grave, covered by brush and trash. After finding the victim, detectives charged Ivey with first degree murder and ordered him held without bail.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     Dr. W. J. Core performed the autopsy. He stated that in his opinion "the pretty young girl died as a result of a fractured skull caused by repeated blows on the head by a heavy, jagged instrument...Dr. Core, who said he examined the body six and a half days after death, said he discovered brush and thorn marks on Miss Kelnhofer's legs which strongly indicated to him that she had been running through heavy brush just prior to her death." Dr. Core found no broken bones or other injuries to her body, except for the head area.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     He said he could not tell if she had been sexually assaulted because of decomposition.
    </span>
   </p>

    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     <b>
      The Trials
     </b>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     At trial, Special Prosecutor Walter "Pete" Haynes stated that only two people know for sure what happened. One is Ivey, he said. The other is Anna Kelnhofer, who now "sleeps in the silent city of the dead."
    </span>
   </p>
   <div>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     The prosecution theorized that Ivey was driving his insurance route when he saw Kelnhofer walking toward the Duck River. He offered the pretty teen a ride, which she accepted, then drove her to Camp Forrest. There, according to the prosecution, he likely made sexual advances toward Kelnhofer and she resisted. At some point, she escaped from his vehicle and fled through the woods. Ivey chased her down and struck her with a tire iron or possibly a rock. Then he hastily buried her.
    </span>
   </div>
   <div>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     <br/>
    </span>
   </div>
   <div>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     Jurors convicted Arthur Roger Ivey of the first degree murder of Anna Kelnhofer and he received a sentence of 99 years.
    </span>
   </div>
   <div>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     <br/>
    </span>
   </div>
   <div>
    <span style="font-size: medium;">
     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      But in
     </span>
     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      1963, the State Supreme Court overturned Ivey's conviction and ordered a new trial. The court ruled that the presiding judge in the first trial "erred in allowing testimony on Ivey's moral character to be introduced." In the first trial, two women testified that they'd had affairs with the defendant. This testimony was meant to convince jurors that Ivey wanted to have sexual relations with Kelnhofer and her rejection was the motive for he murder.
     </span>
    </span>

   <div>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     <br/>
    </span>
   </div>
   <div>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     In the second trial, Ivey's attorneys convinced a new set of jurors that he had indeed accidentally hit Kelnhofer with his car and, in a panic, hid the body. He was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to one-to-five years.

    So two career criminals from California thought it might be a good idea to travel to Springdale, Arkansas and rob a gun shop. What could go wrong?

      entered C  S Gun and Pawn. As they walked in, the duo leveled down on shop owners

     <b style="font-family: georgia;">
      Clint

     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      and

     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      . Holding a semi-automatic handgun, Gould leaped over a glass case to get behind the counters. As he did so, Shirley pulled a .38 caliber revolver from her pocket and fired three rounds. Gould, hit in the shoulder, turned and fired at Shirley as she took cover behind the counter. The robbers, deciding the heist was not such a good idea, fled.
     </span>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p/>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     The Californians jumped into Roberson's car and took off for Fort Smith. There, he deposited Gould at a local hospital. But he soon returned to check on his buddy and both were arrested. Shirley, who was grazed by one of Gould's rounds, was not charged with any crime. Both men faced Attempted Capital Murder charges as well as Aggravated Robbery counts. At trial, each got 37 years in the Arkansas State Prison system.

     ), had committed an armed robbery. Now he jumped out of his car and walked toward the Uber driver. Holding two handguns, Johnson announced he was robbing the occupants of the Toyota. That's when Anderson pulled his own licensed firearm and fired four shots. Johnson, hit by all four rounds, crumpled to the asphalt and died. Anderson was not charged, but since Uber policy prohibits drivers from carrying firearms, he faced termination. In response, Anderson said, "Honestly, it doesn't matter if I lose the job. I have to protect my life. That's all I did."

    Shotgun-Toting Robber Learns a Painful Lesson

     ) at Chip's Quick Stop in Joelton, Tennessee stood outside the convenience store, taking a smoke break. A former Marine, he'd worked there for 19 years.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     With Gonzales holding a stolen shotgun, the three robbers rushed Friend. Two thugs sidled up behind their intended victim while Gonzales aimed his firearm at the clerk's chest and ordered him to go back inside the store. It was over in a second. Friend pulled his weapon and fired one shot, hitting Gonzales in the abdomen. The others fled. Friend moved the shotgun to a safe place, then helped two customers who had just arrived provide first aid for the robber. Gonzales, in critical condition, was transported to Skyline Medical Center.

   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     The robbers were suspected of several other armed robberies in the area. According to WZTV in Nashville, "A Clarksville teen who tried to rob a Nashville store with a shotgun but was shot by the clerk now faces federal charges."

     What was the motive for the attack? Cops don't know. The crime seemed to be about as random as you'll get. It was likely not robbery, since no money or goods were taken. Investigators said the killer had no known criminal record. Maybe he just wanted to kill somebody. Anybody.

     For many years, Dollar Tree sold all items in the store for a dollar. It was the go-to place for many working class citizens. Customers could shop for silverware, greeting cards, dinnerware and dish sets, pottery, groceries, washcloths and towels, party supplies, as well as thousands of other goods. Alas, in today's economic climate, the store has been forced to raise prices to $1.25.

     Keris Riebel was well-known and well-liked in her community. According to her obituary, "Keris was a 2019 graduate of Wynford High School who actively participated in cheerleading. Her classmates remember seeing her walk through the halls with a huge smile and a Bible in her hand. Keris attended Cedarville University and later transferred to Franklin University where she received a BA in [Human Resources] Business Management." She was a member of the Antioch Christian Church.

    <span style="font-size: medium;">
     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      Bekele was indicted on six felony charges, including aggravated murder, and pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Court documents state that he was placed in the Twin Valley Behavioral Health Care Hospital. A judge issued the following statement: "The court finds the defendant is
     </span>

     </i>
     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      competent to stand trial insofar as his ability to understand the nature and objectives of the proceedings against him; however, the court finds the defendant is incompetent to stand trial at this time due to his inability to assist in his own defense."
     </span>

     Whatever that means.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     The killer will be evaluated every six months to determine whether he has improved enough to stand trial.

     <i style="font-family: georgia;">
      pictured above
     </i>
     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      ), a registered sex offender, towered over his would-be victim.
     </span>
    </span>
    <p/>
    <p>
     <span style="font-size: medium;">
      <span style="font-family: georgia;">
       Brecan "Bre" Morgan, 27, had gone to The Laundry Room, a local coin laundry, to wash clothes for her two children. She was having trouble getting the automated washer to accept her dollar bill when Tranchant sidled up, supposedly to help. At the time, they were the only people in the business.
      </span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span style="font-size: medium;">
      <span style="font-family: georgia;">
       Bre, a single mother of two, works as a mental health technician and plans to attend nursing school.
      </span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span style="font-size: medium;">
      <span style="font-family: georgia;">
       In order to focus public attention on the numerous sex offenders living in Lacombe, she decided to identify herself and give interviews to reporters from WDSU News and WWLTV. (NOTE: I've compiled statements given by the victim into sequential order.)
      </span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span style="font-size: medium;">
      <span>
       <span style="font-family: georgia;">
        "He came up to me ," Bre said, "and he pretended like he was trying to help me put my dollar in [the automatic washer] and he got right up behind me. That's when he made it clear like he was, his intentions were to assault me.
       </span>
      </span>
      <span style="font-family: georgia;">
       I actually didn't see the weapon at first. He said, 'Give [it up] and you won't die.'"
      </span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span style="font-size: medium;">
      <span style="font-family: georgia;">
       The predator wasted no time. Tranchant grabbed her hair and attempted to drag her into the bathroom. Bre fought back, grabbing anything she could to keep from moving toward the back room.
      </span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span style="font-size: medium;">
      <span style="font-family: georgia;">
       Bre explained that "I was hanging onto the wall at one point. My shirt and my jacket came off. I was just trying everything like to get away. My biggest fear was my kids would have to grow up without me."
      </span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span style="font-size: medium;">
      <span style="font-family: georgia;">
       As they struggled, Tranchant pulled out his knife and stabbed her in the side. By this time, he had dragged her into the bathroom. That's when the attacker set his knife aside.
      </span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      Bre wasted no time in grabbing the blade and stabbing her assailant--twice. She then fled to the parking lot and called St. Tammany's Parish Sheriff's Office. Deputies quickly responded. They found the lifeless body of Tranchant on the floor of the laundromat.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      <span style="font-size: medium;">
       As Bre ended the interview, she said something that seemed to startle the reporter: "If you don't believe in God, you should. As soon as I got done asking God to help me, [Tranchant] put the knife down. That's when I picked it up and used it against him."
      </span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      Bre was transported to a local hospital for treatment of her wounds.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      St. Tammany's Parish Sheriff Randy Smith said, "I want to compliment this woman on the courage and strength she showed in fighting back against her attacker and ask for prayers for her continued recovery."
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      This story might have ended differently. Deputies could have found
      <i>
       Bre
      </i>
      dead inside the laundromat. Without her heroic actions, Nicholas Tranchant would almost certainly have targeted other women. Rapists rarely stop until they're caught, become disabled, or die. Bre's actions no doubt saved many women.
     </span>

      Reporters soon learned that in the small town of Lacombe, Louisiana, there are numerous registered sex offenders. WGNO reported that "according to data from the National Sex Offender Registry, there are more than 200 sex offenders living in Lacombe. That's something residents say needs to change." Bre is calling for local officials to reduce the number of offenders living in one area.

     Have you ever heard of Harry and Janet Lodholm? This Lakewood, Washington couple survived a brutal home invasion by a murderous gang that mistook their house for that of a drug-dealer they planned to rob. Crashing through the front door, the gang pistol-whipped Harry and slashed Janet with a knife. When the assailants finally realized they had chosen the wrong house, they took what valuables they could find and fled, leaving the bound and tortured victims stunned and bloody. In their haste to leave, however, the robbers left their backpack in the house--worse yet, the backpack contained their cellphones. In the meantime, the couple had freed themselves and relocked the front door. The frustrated gang broke into the house for the second time, determined now to silence the victims who could identify them and retrieve the evidence that would send them back to prison. But the robbers hadn't counted on the couple's resilience. Harry and Janet had retreated to their bedroom. As Janet dialed 9-1-1, Harry grabbed his firearm. When the gang kicked down the bedroom door, Harry and his 9mm semiautomatic made quick work of the robbers.

     Based on police reports, interviews with victims, court documents, media sources, and other public records,
     <i>
      Guns and Self-Defense
     </i>
     recounts the courage and resourcefulness of armed citizens who refused to become easy prey.

     Each story is set in a time and place. Characters are delineated in depth, both would-be victims and attackers. The aftermath of many of these stories are poignant. In some cases, the victims suffered life-altering injuries, as well as lingering mental trauma. Without a weapon, most would have been murdered. Many of the assailants were hardcore drug users; others had mental health issues. In still other cases, street gangs, unconcerned with any sense of right and wrong, preyed on the innocent. The majority of attackers had been in prison, and most had been released early.

     By the way, for those who fancy identity politics, the would-be victims in this book represent a microcosm of America: liberals, conservatives, independents, white people, black people, other minorities, males, females, the able-bodied, and the disabled.

    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     What kinds of weapons did these would-be victims use? A woman home alone used a shotgun. Several used semiautomatic handguns. Others used revolvers. In one case, a wheelchair-bound victim used a pistol loaded with 16-gauge shotgun shells. In two cases, convenience stores had a "house gun," a weapon stashed beneath the counter that employees could use in case it was needed.

     All these cases involved "righteous" self-defense--meaning the would-be victim acted legally and was not charged with any crime. In many of the cases, law enforcement officials praised the citizens' actions.

     You'll read about the drug-addled thug who tried to rob two disabled old ladies in a low-income retirement home. (It might have been funny if it wasn't deadly serious.) After being severely injured by the assailant, one of the women used a small .22-caliber handgun she called a "derringer" to stop the violent assault. The "derringer" did its job: it paralyzed the assailant so he can never hurt anyone else.

     You'll read about the nurse who helped police capture a gang of carjackers that had been terrorizing the city of Milwaukee for months. The night before, they shot an innocent victim in the jaw, nearly killing him. The nurse, however, had a concealed carry permit, and put an end to the crime spree when they attempted to carjack her. (One member of this gang also ended up partially paralyzed.) Sometimes what goes around comes around!

       The last chapter in the book involves a street gang that actually named themselves "The Cutthroat Committee." One summer morning, in Jacksonville, Florida, as Pam Coker got ready to go to work, she heard a loud bang, then the back door exploded open. Her husband, Foster, didn't have to be at work until later, so he was sleeping. An intruder raced toward Pam and pummeled her to the floor. Foster heard the commotion and ran out to help his wife. He engaged the much younger home invader, and the two fought a horrific hand-to-hand battle in the middle of the living room. Finally, Foster, bloody and about to pass out, told Pam, "Honey, you've got to get my gun." The intruder, armed with an Beretta Centurion (
       <i>
        pictured above
       </i>
       ) that had a "30 clip," kept hitting Foster with the butt of the gun. Blood flowed all over the home as Foster and the invader fought from room to room
      </span>
     </span>
     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      . While Pam, with severely injured legs, stumbled to the bedroom to retrieve her husband's gun, the wild fight continued. Pam returned with a five-shot revolver and handed it to Foster. The homeowner emptied it, hitting the assailant three times. That's when the intruder fired a shot that grazed Foster's head. With his gun empty, Foster realized the attacker still wasn't dead. He jumped back onto the invader, pinning down the Beretta to keep him from shooting again. Pam once again hobbled back to the bedroom, grabbed a second pistol, came back, and shot the invader twice. This intruder, like the Lodholm gang, had mistakenly pegged the Coker home to be that of drug dealers. Because of the actions of Foster and Pam Coker, the Cutthroat Committee was disbanded by police. All the members of the gang ended up in prison. Their attacker, a founding member, ended up in the graveyard.

      On June 2, 1945, Frederic Hensel, born in Virginia and raised by an uncle in Kentucky after he was orphaned, found himself on a small Pacific island called Okinawa. A tank battalion master sergeant with the 77th Infantry Division, Hensel soon learned that Okinawa was a miserable place for tank warfare. Relentless rain, rugged terrain, a doggedly determined enemy, and a vast network of cleverly formed defenses slowed advancement to a crawl. It took American GIs 82 days of brutal fighting to capture the island. 16,000 Americans would die there, and a staggering 40,000 would be wounded.

     "Hensel’s injuries were devastating," Time reported. "The explosion blew off both legs above the knee, his left arm above the elbow, [and] mangled his right hand…" While on the ship carrying him back to the states, his crushed hand developed a "gaseous gangrene infection" and had to be amputated.

       Once Hensel arrived at Percy Jones Hospital in Battle Creek, Michigan, the media got wind of his arrival. No one, even the battle-numbed doctors and nurses, had seen injuries this severe. They quickly informed newsmen that Hensel was the only living soldier during all of World War II who had lost every limb. (NOTE: Before the war ended, four more soldiers would endure the same type of wounds.)

      He was fortunate to have physicians and nurses familiar with rehabilitating soldiers who had grievous wounds. Time reporters wrote: "Eventually Sergeant Hensel will be far from helpless. After operations on all four stumps, he will get artificial limbs and be able to walk again. Last week, still suffering from shock and slightly deaf from concussion, he was thinking of starting a little chicken farm when he is discharged. He told reporters, 'This sure changes things a lot…I’d make an excellent propaganda photo to end all wars.' His dark-haired wife, at the hospital to greet him, said, 'We’ll get along fine.'"

     <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: medium; vertical-align: baseline;">
      Jewel, his wife, charmed reporters. A photogenic woman with a captivating "Southern accent," they had been married for three years. Newspapers raved about her beauty and her loyalty to her husband.

     <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: medium; vertical-align: baseline;">
      Before he joined the army, Hensel had known only farming. As a child, he toiled on his uncle’s Kentucky farm. He informed reporters that, except for war, farming was all he knew. The plucky soldier’s determination to overcome his handicap resonated with Americans on the home-front.

     <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: medium; vertical-align: baseline;">
      Out of the blue, someone sent a small check to Hensel to help him buy a farm. Newspapers quickly joined forces with everyday citizens and soon Hensel found himself deluged with donations. Many checks were for only a dollar or two, but they added up. The Associated Press wrote that Sergeant Hensel and his wife, Jewel, "received some $60,000 in cash gifts today as they celebrated their third wedding anniversary. Hensel captured the admiration of the public when he arrived here from Okinawa five weeks ago and announced that he was going into the chicken farm business despite what seemed like insurmountable handicaps."

     <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: medium; vertical-align: baseline;">
      That money would buy him a nice farm. While many men may have quickly blown through the cash, Hensel and his wife did not. Eighteen months after entering the hospital, Hensel left in a wheelchair. He now had two new artificial arms and hooks, as well as prosthetic legs. He did indeed buy a chicken farm in Kentucky, but a couple of years afterwards, sold out, moved to Alabama, and bought a dairy farm. He hired employees to do the milking and physical work he could not do.

     <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: medium; vertical-align: baseline;">
      Hensel prospered and became known as a successful businessman. He and Jewel had four children. Eventually, they retired to south Florida. Jewel died in 1987 at sixty-seven years of age.

     "To choose one's victims, to prepare one's plans minutely, to slake an implacable vengeance, and then go to bed...there is nothing sweeter in the world."
    </i>
    Joseph Stalin
   </span>
   <p/>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia;">
     <span style="font-size: medium;">
      In his far-sweeping book about communism, Dr. Miguel Faria, Jr. describes a hellish nightmare. Almost every page drips with the blood of victims, most unknown, but many high-ranking, or even famous. My thought at the end of the book was, who in his or her right mind would wish to live in such a society? And yet, many who thrive under freedom in today's world seem to have a yen for communistic-style governments.
     </span>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     So what is communism? Faria writes: "To paraphrase Mao Tse-tung, communism is the attainment of political power by the barrel of a gun and complete control of all services and the methods of production, distribution, and consumption of goods by the omnipotent state."
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-size: medium;">
     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      The oppressors and killers who rule totalitarian dictatorships care nothing for the people they rule.
     </span>
     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      Joseph Stalin, an unredeemable psychopath, murdered or caused the deaths of at least 20-40 million of his own people. Mao Tse-tung also killed 20-40 million. (These staggering numbers are low--there were likely millions more unknown victims.)
     </span>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-size: medium;">
     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      Because he murdered friends and enemies alike, as well as millions of anonymous souls caught in his web, Faria calls Stalin's reign the "meat grinder." This is an apt description. The author writes that "Stalin would use terror indiscriminately as a matter of course, not only against the civilian population but also most ominously and unflinchingly against his former comrades, and without sparing the families of political opponents (including his own)."
     </span>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-size: medium;">
     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      Nickolai Yezhov, chief executioner for Stalin, is an example of what happened when an insider knew more than he should. Yezhov was no innocent: he may have been responsible for a half-million torture-murders orchestrated by the Russian dictator. But he ended up being labeled a "traitor" by Stalin and was dispatched with a bullet to the brain.

     Maria A. Spiridonova (
     <i>

     </i>
     ) suffered for decades at the hands of both Lenin and Stalin. In 1918, she criticized the Bolsheviks, saying, "I accuse you of betraying the peasants, of making use of them for your own ends." Faria writes, "Spiridonova was persecuted for years, arrested, harshly interrogated, released, resentenced repeatedly, sent to various labor camps and settlements in the Gulag and in exile. Finally, she was executed in 1941."

     Life was not pleasant for most Russians.
     <br/>
    </span>
    <p/>
    <p>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      Faria writes that Russian "citizens died from privations, neglect, and mistreatment; of starvation from government-orchestrated famines; diseases due to malnutrition; and mass executions or a simple shot to the back of the head. They died in prisons, in their homes, during mass deportations, and from overwork and exposure while slaving away in the Gulag system of destructive labor camps."

       Arthur Koestler, a former communist and author of the anti-communist book,
       <i>
        Darkness At Noon
       </i>
       , wrote: "I went to Communism as one goes to a spring of fresh water and I left Communism as one clambers out of a poisoned river strewn with the wreckage of flooded cities and corpses of the drowned."

    </p>
    <p>
     <span style="font-size: medium;">
      <span style="font-family: georgia;">
       Communism in Russia was a total and complete disaster for its people. Faria has covered it all. From the well-known overthrow and murders of former Tsarist government officials, to the Great Purges, to rounding up and assassinating almost all the old Bolsheviks, to Stalin's brutal war on intellectuals and Russia's Jewish population, to his deliberate starving of millions of Ukrainians, and much more...the list of victims continues through Faria's book.

     <span style="font-size: medium;">
      <span style="font-family: georgia;">
       Years after communism in Russia failed, former President Boris Yeltsin said, "Our country has not been lucky...It was decided to carry out this Marxist experiment on us...It has simply pushed us off the path the world's civilized nations have taken...in the end,
       <i>

       Eastern-style communism under China's Mao Tse-tung was no better.
      </span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span style="font-size: medium;">
      <span style="font-family: georgia;">
       Faria writes that "Mao committed whatever crimes were necessary to attain and preserve supreme political power. For him, democracy, justice, equality, fraternity, and freedom were merely words to be used for propaganda purposes--not ideas to be pursued."
      </span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span style="font-size: medium;">
      <span style="font-family: georgia;">
       Anyone unfortunate enough to be born into a political system where one individual has complete power will be subjugated to the leader. That was true under Stalin, and true under Mao. Communism is an easy system for tyrants to manipulate.
      </span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span style="font-size: medium;">
      <span style="font-family: georgia;">
       The research done by Faria is amazing. In
       <i>
        Stalin, Mao, Communism, and their 21st Century Aftermath in Russia and China
       </i>
       , the author quotes from numerous works about Russian and Chinese history. He has published more than a hundred high-quality photos of many of the players involved. He has tied together disparate parts of a massive jigsaw puzzle of events and framed them into a terrifying whole. With so much going on in secretive societies such as Russia and China, that's hard to do.
      </span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span style="font-size: medium;">
      <span style="font-family: georgia;">
       After Mao won the Chinese civil war against President Chiang Kai-shek, he ruled as a ruthless dictator. Faria writes: "Tragically, the significant and historic events in communist China were not peaceful socio-economic advances, but militant initiatives begun by Chairman Mao to destroy the bourgeoisie, wipe out traditional mores, erase and rewrite Chinese history, and construct a fully self-sufficient communist state..."
      </span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span style="font-size: medium;">
      <span style="font-family: georgia;">
       Unfortunately, Mao's policies "only brought social upheaval and violence, economic disaster, devastation, suffering, and death."
      </span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span style="font-size: medium;">
      <span>
       <span style="font-family: georgia;">
        Faria juxtaposes the former Chinese communist government with the current government.
       </span>
      </span>
      <span style="font-family: georgia;">
       President Xi Jinping is slicker and craftier than Mao, but his goals remain much the same, i.e., domination of all who fall into his orbit.
      </span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      Because of its historical significance, this book will find an audience. But will the modernists of our generation learn from the past? That, to me is the critical question.

      As she drove to the Belleair shopping center where she worked, the petite mother of three didn't realize she was being followed. Long-time criminals Zy’Nika Ayesha Woods, 19, and her boyfriend, Joseph Harrell, 17, trailed Troung for 24 miles.

      At about 11:30 A.M., while Woods waited in the car, Harrell stalked his prey. He approached Truong as she walked down the sidewalk. Sensing that Harrell had invaded her space, Truong attempted to move out of his way, but he suddenly seized her around her waist and flung her against a wall. The items she carried, including the envelope with her money, flew from her hand and were strewn across the sidewalk. Truong then collapsed onto the concrete.

      The city of Houston reeled in shock. It’s sometimes hard to ascertain why some cases go viral while others don’t, but this one had all the ingredients that terrorize people. An innocent victim and mother of three lay hospitalized with broken ribs and a fractured spine. Unable to walk, doctors opined that she might never make a full recovery.
     </span>
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">
     <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">
      Harrell, already out on bond for a weapons charge, would later be charged with yet another robbery that occurred just days after this assault. In one of the dumb things criminals sometimes do, he posted a photo of himself on Tik Tok wearing the same distinctive shirt he wore during Troung’s assault.
     </span>
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">
     <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">
      A few weeks later, Harrell was identified and arrested. A judge initially set his bond at $200,000.
     </span>
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">
     <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">
      Authorities routinely record jailhouse telephone conversations, and the public got an earful from Harrell. “We was snatching purses,” he told a friend. “I snatched a purse. Basically when I snatched the purse the lady ran with the money. I grabbed her and slammed her and she’s paralyzed.” Harrell can be heard chuckling as he recounts the crime.
     </span>
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">
     <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">
      When the friend explained that Truong had received $230,000 from a “gofundme” page, Harrell brightened up even more. He opined that he shouldn’t be charged with
     </span>
     <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;">
      any
     </span>
     <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">
      crime because the victim would now be okay.
     </span>
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">
     <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">
      But the victim would

     <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;">
      not
     </span>
     <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">
      be okay.
     </span>
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">
     <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">
      Houston Police Chief Troy Finner held a press conference and said, “This type of violence will not be tolerated in our city. It is just senseless. I just spoke to Ms. Troung…and assured her, and I want the city of Houston to stand behind us. These are very serious injuries. The recovery is very long. And I want her to know the love of our agency but also the great citizens in this city.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">
     <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">
      Citizens did respond and raised more than $250,000 to help the injured woman pay her medical bills.
     </span>
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">
     <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">
      Then Houston's completely broken criminal justice system struck back against law-abiding citizens...again. Yet another Houston judge, this time a Republican, reduced Harrell’s bond by half. Judge Kristin Guiney reset his bond to $100,000. Fortunately for the Houston community, though, Harrell was still unable to make bond and get out of jail.
     </span>
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">
     <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">
      At trial, Harrell pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated robbery causing serious bodily injury. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison. Insiders familiar with the Texas justice system, however, say it’s likely he’ll be out in 15. (Watch out, Hustletown, when a fully matured and even meaner Joseph Harrell returns to your fair city.)
     </span>
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">
     <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">
      His accomplice, Ny’Nika Woods, pleaded guilty to a downgraded charge of robbery causing bodily injury. She was sentenced to 10 years in prison.

     <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">
      Speaking in Vietnamese, Troung told reporters that “I’m feeling very horrible and sad at the same time. They don’t know when my leg can walk again. I need to practice, try to walk and stuff. I’m very sad that this happened to me and I just want to let other people know to be careful.”

      The Jugging Murder

      On the morning of September 23, 2021,
      <b>
       Martha Medina
      </b>
      , 71, pulled up to a Chase Bank ATM in Houston, Texas and made a small cash withdrawal. She then drove to McDonald's at 430 Uvalde Road, parked near the entrance, and walked inside to purchase takeout breakfasts for her family. As she walked back to her car holding a bag of food and her purse, she had no idea she'd been followed from the bank by three career criminals. On the streets, they call it "jugging."
     </span>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-size: medium;">
     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      Unlike Martha, a productive, well-respected member of her community, 41-year-old
      <b>
       Andrew Williams
      </b>
      had been a violent felon for most of his existence. In 2000, he spent time in the state prison for aggravated robbery. In 2014, Williams served time for fraud and feloniously using another person's identification. After being released, Williams ran down his girlfriend with his car but served little jail time.

    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-size: medium;">
     <span>
      <span style="font-family: georgia;">
       And in 2019, he shot a bystander during an armed robbery, killing her. Doug
      </span>
     </span>
     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      Wylie wrote: "Williams...[was] involved in a 'drug deal gone bad' when Chima Ogbonnaya was shot in the back of the head and left for dead in a darkened, desolate parking lot." After Williams was arrested, the prosecutor urged 248th Criminal District Court Judge Hilary Unger to deny bond. However, the judge disagreed and soon the lifelong criminal was back on the streets of Houston, i.e., Hustletown.

   <p>
    <span style="font-size: medium;">
     <span>

       At the time he murdered Martha Medina, Williams wore an ankle monitor
      </span>
     </span>
     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      . This helped police seal their case against him.

     </b>
     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      ,
     </span>
     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      allegedly assisted him. A police spokesperson said Thomas served as a lookout while Williams and Ford committed the robbery. Williams ran toward Medina as she was getting into her car. He quickly wrested her purse away and, in the scuffle, Medina fell to the ground. The robbers rushed back to the getaway car and climbed in. Williams, driving, sped through the McDonald's parking lot and ran over Medina, who was lying on the pavement.
     </span>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-size: medium;">
     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      Wylie wrote: "Williams waited for his victim to emerge from the eatery with take-out food in hand. Then, he began his assault with a strong-armed purse-snatching, got into his car, and during his attempted escape struck Medina, running her over and dragging her some distance beneath the vehicle."
     </span>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-size: medium;">
     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      Bystanders attempted to give Medina aid, but she was pronounced dead when she arrived at a local hospital.
     </span>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-size: medium;">
     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      The court recently convicted Williams of murdering Martha Medina and sentenced him to life in prison. (The other alleged suspects are awaiting trial.)

   <p>
    <span style="font-size: medium;">
     <span>
      <span style="font-family: georgia;">
       Judge Unger narrowly won reelection against Republican challenger Julian Ramirez. During her campaign, she made no bones about her beliefs.
      </span>
     </span>
     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      "Courts should find alternatives to incarceration with an eye towards rehabilitation," Unger wrote on her website.

    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     It would have been an amazing transformation for Andrew Williams to go from a past riddled with drugs, violence and murder to becoming a model citizen. Elections mean something. If you don't believe it, look at this case. Had Ramirez been elected, he likely would not have let Andrew Williams bond out for murdering Ogbonnaya.

     On Sunday morning, December 10, seventeen-year-old Louise Wilson (

     ) was traveling from Whitney, Texas to Galveston. Two passengers, one in the front seat, the other in the back, traveled with her. On the Pierce Elevated on I-45 in Houston, she swerved to avoid a braking vehicle in front of her. In doing so, she accidently cut in front of another car.

     The unidentified driver (

    Louise, much-loved, had just graduated from high school. Her father addressed the media. "To my daughter's killer," he said, "I want to say that you're a coward. But unlike how you've taken Louise's life, we have taken yours. We've just given you up to 20,000 reasons to doubt and not trust everyone in your world right now. You will have to live with that doubt for the rest of your life, having to wonder who might turn you in--your mom, dad, brother, sister or friends, [and] those who [you] bragged to about what you did to our little girl."

     California Storeowners are Literally Up in Arms
    </b>
   </span>

     <br/>
    </span>
   </div>
   <div>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     On January 1, 2024, at about 10:00 A.M., two armed robbers burst into the MSM Jewelry Store in Oakland, California.
    </span>
   </div>
   <div>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     <br/>
    </span>
   </div>
   <div>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     The owner, who wished to remain unidentified, told police he saw two men park their car in the wrong direction outside the store. When they exited their car, he noticed they wore masks and held semiautomatic weapons. As they entered the business, the owner opened fire with a 9mm handgun. He said, "They told me, 'don't move or we'll shoot.' So I started shooting at them because they had guns pointed at me. They were shooting back."
    </span>
   </div>
   <div>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     <br/>
    </span>
   </div>
   <div>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     Both robbers quickly realized they were facing a determined foe, so like cowards, they turned and scampered for the door. One fell and lost his shoe as he was slipping and sliding across the slick the floor. The owner insists he hit one in the shoulder.
    </span>
   </div>
   <div>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     <br/>
    </span>
   </div>
   <div>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     The store owner was not charged with any crime.
    </span>
   </div>
   <div>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     <br/>
    </span>
   </div>
   <div>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     Maybe the California authorities will get DNA from that lost shoe. And maybe they'll arrest the robber. And maybe they'll charge him with something like, say,
     <i>
      attempted murder
     </i>
     . Or maybe, like usual, prosecutors will let him go with no indictment and no punishment. California's criminal justice system under Governor Gavin Newsom is becoming a joke for the rest of the country to laugh at. Unfortunately, it's not funny for the people who live and work there.
    </span>
   </div>
   <div>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     <br/>
    </span>
   </div>
   <div>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     Robberies in Oakland are so prevalent that some city council members are calling for a meeting with police to discuss how to reduce the mayhem.
    </span>

    </span>
   </div>
   <div>

     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      I have one suggestion: in the next election,
     </span>
     <span style="font-family: georgia;">
      vote for prosecutors who will take crime seriously.

     "It's Terrifying Living in California"
    </span>
   </b>
   <p/>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     By Robert A. Waters
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     On December 11, 2023, a gang of smash and grab robbers stormed into the Estates Consignment store in Pleasant Hill, California. It was the middle of the day when a "scout," a woman dressed in a colorful dress, wandered around the shop eyeing surveillance cameras and speaking into her cell phone. A security guard stood at the locked door, allowing customers to enter and exit.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     When the woman left the building, she held the door open long enough so the group of thieves could force their way inside. Two robbers threatened the unarmed security guard, holding him at bay, while five men raced straight toward the jewelry section of the store. One robber carried a sledgehammer. Expensive rings, watches, necklaces and high-end gems sat in glass cases near the rear of the store.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     As the men neared the jewelry cases, a clerk screamed, alerting business owner
     <b>
      Albert Marcu
     </b>
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     The brazen attitude of the thieves struck him. They acted like they owned the store. Marcu pulled a .38-caliber revolver from his pocket and moved to confront the men. "I told them to 'watch it' and they saw the gun and ran away," he said.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     That's an understatement. As they neared the counter and noticed the gun, they stopped dead in their tracks. It was if all five men hit a brick wall at once. They halted, turned and sprinted for the door, kicking over chairs in their panicky flight.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     In thirty seconds, the thugs were gone.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     Albert Marcu is a remarkable man. He grew up in communist Romania, but fled when he was 19. He landed in Germany and obtained a degree in architecture there. Immigrating to America, Marcu worked for a few years in that profession. However, his passion was making and repairing jewelry and he soon opened his successful Estates Consignment shop.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     After defending his store, the storeowner gave interviews to several networks.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     "I feel very, very bad for this country," he said, "which is one of the best countries in the world. We beg the politicians to help us small businesses and help communities all over California. I'd say about 99% of my customers complain about crime."
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     Marcu told reporters he had a premonition his store might be hit "as large-scale retail thefts have become synonymous with the Bay area."
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     In an interview with Fox News, Marcu was asked about Governor Gavin Newsom's claim that San Francisco outperformed other areas in the state in reducing thefts. "Not true," Marcu said emphatically.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     "I didn't want to shoot anybody," he said. "But I have to make a statement. Too many bad things have happened. Stores get robbed left and right. I have a message for all business owners, to take example and fight for themselves, because if you don't fight for yourself, nobody will."
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     "It's terrifying living in California," Marcu said.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     As of this writing, none of the would-be robbers that attacked Albert Marcu's consignment store have been apprehended. If they are caught, they'll likely be released and face no charges. (In the Golden State, many prosecutors refuse to indict criminals except for the most violent crimes.)

     Fennario: Scottish Folk Song Becomes Americanized
    </b>
   </span>
   <p/>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     By Robert A. Waters
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     Fennario, a town mentioned in an old folk song, does not exist in Scotland...or America. The fictionalized city was actually a small town near Aberdeen called Fyvie. The original title of the tune may have been "Peggy-O" or "The Bonnie Lass of Fyvie." Although the author is unknown, the song is thought to have been written around 1640. (That seems amazing to me--this tune of the common folk is nearly 400 years old and still being sung in various forms.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     The story is about the captain of an invading army who falls in love with a beautiful girl in the town he has conquered. In many versions, the girl rejects him and the captain "dies for love." The ballad is often sung in the third person, by one of the captain's soldiers.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     In an earlier iteration, the song starts with the following lines: "There once was a troop of Irish dragoons/Cam marching doon through Fyvie-O." In an Americanized version, lyrics to the song begin: "As we marched down to Fennario/We marched down to Fennario/Our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove/And they called her Pretty Peggy-O."
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     In America, numerous versions are extant. While the Grateful Dead never recorded the song, they played it often in their concerts. Bob Dylan called the song "Peggy-O" and recorded it on his first album. Joan Baez recorded the tune during the folk revival of the 1960s. Many others have put it on tape, vinyl, or CDs.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     How did a song sail across three thousand miles of ocean and land in America?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     In the 1700s, many immigrants from Scotland, England, Wales and Ireland settled in the southern Appalachians. These states include North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and Kentucky. Life on the frontier was often brutal, but settlers brought their music with them. Initially, they would sing the old songs with the same lyrics they had learned back in the old world. But eventually, lyrics changed to reflect life in the new world.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     For instance, the popular country song, "Knoxville Girl," began its life in the English town of Wittam. The song had numerous versions as it wandered through the English countryside. At some point, someone decided to transport the murder of an innocent girl from England to Knoxville, Tennessee. In the early 1900s, as technology evolved so voices and musical instruments could be recorded, "Knoxville Girl" became a standard in the repertoire of many folk and country crooners.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     Life in the Appalachians was hard. For more than a century, the average lifespan of those who settled there was about 35 years. Accidental death, violent death, and early death from natural causes, including childbirth, was prevalent. (

    While the original song allegedly took place in a war between Ireland and Scotland, the lyrics in America morphed into a different conflict: the Civil War.
   </span>

      There are no mountains anywhere close to Mount Dora, Florida. However, it is situated on a plateau 185 feet above sea level. In 1888, surveyors, possibly in jest, named the town after an early settler and its high elevation. The normally peaceful community sits in Lake County. A hundred years after receiving its name, Mount Dora had a population of about 10,000 souls.

After leaving the bank briefly [Anderson] returned with both revolvers, forced Young and Scott into the bank vault, and ordered them to fill a trash bag with money. Then after asking the women who wanted to die first, Anderson began firing both [.22-caliber] revolvers, killing Young and paralyzing Scott. Anderson fired a total of ten shots, nine of which hit the victims."

       As the robbery and murder was unfolding in real time, Sherry Howard entered the bank with her two children. She saw Anderson in the vault firing multiple handguns, and quickly exited. Anderson had not seen her. She raced to Publix and yelled for someone to call police. Howard later testified she heard Scott yell, "Please don't" or "Please, no." Immediately after that, the witness heard additional gunshots.

     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      After cops arrived, officers spotted Anderson still inside the bank, attempting to remove a VCR containing surveillance video. More officers arrived and arrested Anderson holding a "trash can" containing $75,000.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      Paramedics rushed Young and Scott to local hospitals.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      Heather Young died while being transported to the hospital. According to court documents, "the forensic pathologist who performed the autopsy on Heather Young testified that Young had a total of seven gunshot wounds. She said that all of Young's wounds could have been fatal, with the possible exception of a wound that had entered Young's chin and exited near the eye. [Another] of the wounds had a pattern of gunpower 'tattooing' around it, which indicated that it had been fired at close range."

    <p>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      Scott had been shot twice. One round hit her in the shoulder. Another struck her neck, severing her spinal cord. She would be a paraplegic for the rest of her life.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      The verdict in Anderson's trial was a foregone conclusion. Overwhelming evidence included DNA matches of the victims' blood on Anderson's clothing and shoes; ballistics matches of bullets from one of the guns used in the crime; the killer having been caught at the scene; and several confessions. At trial, Anderson was convicted of the first-degree murder of Young, attempted first-degree murder of Scott, armed robbery, and grand theft of a firearm. The jury unanimously sentenced him to death.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      <br/>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      On February 4, 2015, Marishia Scott died of complications from her paralysis. Her death ended sixteen years of hard suffering.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      Before being shot, Scott had been at a good point in her life. A "country" girl, she lived on a farm with her long-time partner and fiance, Clint Brighurst. In addition to farming, they raised cattle. One friend told reporters that Marishia was "such a happy person. Both she and Clint are very hard workers, and they were always planning ahead." From 1999 to her death 16 years later, Scott remained a paraplegic.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      Heather Young's longtime boyfriend, David Curlow, spoke of romantic trips they'd taken to the Caribbean, of parasailing in Key West, and of spending "quiet evenings in lawn chairs by the lake."
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      After Scott's death, prosecutors considered charging Anderson with her murder. However, they, along with Scott's family, decided not to take him to trial. Scott has run out of appeals on his death sentence, and the district attorney knew a conviction in Scott's case would open a pandora's box of future appeals.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
      When will Anderson face the vaunted needle? Who knows? It might be decades. It could be never. Many people realize there's little
      <i>
       real
      </i>
      justice in America. This case proves the point.

      John P. McCown
     </b>
     (

     ), a career soldier and graduate
of West Point, joined the Confederate army. His resume up to that point had
been typical of lifers. He’d fought with the United States army in the Mexican American
war, the Seminole Wars, and in Utah, Nebraska, and the Dakota Territory. His
service, while not spectacular, was above average.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p align="left" class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     In the Civil War,
his record was spotty. In 1863, Confederate General Braxton Bragg
court-martialed McCown, ostensibly for disobeying orders at the Battle of
Murfreesboro in Tennessee. After his six-month suspension without pay, he
continued to fight until the very end. He surrendered and was paroled on May
12, 1865. (Later evidence indicates the court-martial of McCown was likely
triggered by his virulent criticism of the tactics of Bragg and CSA President
Jefferson Davis.)

    While serving in
the west before the Civil War, McCown became interested in ornithology.
   </span>
   <p/>
   <p align="left" class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     According to Audubon Magazine, "In 1851, John P. McCown, an amateur ornithologist and army officer stationed in Texas, shot a group of larks on the prairie. Examining his kills, he noted two examples of birds he'd never seen before: pale gray longspurs with a spot of chestnut on the wings and prominent white patches in the tail. After preparing the specimens, he sent [them] off to an ornithologist friend, who gave it the name McCown's Longpsur."
    </span>
   </p>
   <p align="left" class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     In the 1800s,amateur ornithologists across the country often mailed specimens to places such as the Smithsonian Institution for identification. Many times, new birds would be named for its discoverer or the place it was found. This method of documenting species led to the naming of thousands of birds, fish and animals.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p align="left" class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     But in 2018, ornithologists began a campaign to rob many a bird of its given name. Slave-owners, colonizers, Confederates, alleged white supremacists, and other "deplorable" humans were to be banned from having his or her name grace any fowl.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p align="left" class="MsoNormal">

     Even John James Audubon doesn't make the cut with ornithologists now because he owned slaves and hated abolitionists. In the near future, we can expect the Frenchman who did so much to define our natural environment to be banned from polite society with other reviled Americans, such as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and, of course, Robert E. Lee.

     In fact, almost no person who lived 150 years ago or more can meet the insane standards of today's moralists. (NOTE: If you don't believe it, look up some of Abraham Lincoln's comments about black Americans.)

     Zack Waters, a veteran researcher and writer on Florida’s Civil War, has written a very comprehensive survey of guerrilla warfare in east and south Florida. It is based on a huge amount of reading and research in the available secondary literature, as well as in the records of Florida’s Civil War government and federal records of the War of the Rebellion (OR) and Official Records of the Union and Confederate Navies in the War of the Rebellion (ORN). He looks at engagements at all levels, from ambushes to pitched, although small-scale, battles. He recounts Union officers being captured while partying and wagon trains seized on the way to Union-held towns and fortifications, as well as battles for towns—Gainesville, Jacksonville. It is hard to imagine a fight he has missed, including a bloodless skirmish on a creek I crossed every day going to junior high and high school. As long as the conflict can be classified as a guerrilla action, or involves men he identifies as guerrillas, he recounts it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     This coverage is vital for understanding Florida’s Civil War, because all the Confederate government wanted from Florida [were] soldiers and cattle, and it essentially abandoned the state early in the war. Florida’s Confederate soldiers would fight in the Armies of Northern Virginia and Tennessee, leaving the defense of the state to its own resources—which, as Florida’s governor, John Milton, quickly realized, meant a regiment under state control. His efforts resulted by mid-1862 in the 2nd Florida Cavalry, raised by locally influential men, generally large planters, and soon operating as guerrillas. One of the companies, from Marion County (Ocala), was led by John J. Dickison, who would be the state’s most effective partisan raider, and whose memoir would become Waters’ prime source for combat descriptions.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     Waters is very aware of the dangers of research into a topic as controversial, then and now, as guerrilla warfare. His sources are inherently biased—often for self-glorification or self-defense. Postwar memoirs could easily be caught up in “Lost Cause” rhetoric of gallant knights and loyal squires. Northern newspapers were just as prone to puffery as Southern, and even Dickison, Waters notes, was never modest.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     Waters deals with this by juxtaposing accounts by both sides, to an effect that sometimes makes it hard to believe they are depicting the same engagement. Civilians caught up in the fighting suffered disproportionately and bitterly resented guerrilla leaders who enforced conscription or impressed supplies. Especially late in the war, the fighting devolved into robbery, revenge murder, arson, and family rivalry for local power, completely divorced from military goals. Race, of course, was central to the war, and Waters does not shy away from the bigotry that hamstrung cooperation between white unionist Floridians and the African Americans in the United States Army. It is clear that some guerrillas imprisoned white captives but lynched black ones as runaways or “deserters.” (Waters applauds Dickison for, unlike other guerrillas, not killing captives white or black.) And, in the end, there were totally meaningless murders.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     The book is organized chronologically and by region, and that results in some repetition. And while Florida was isolated from the rest of the Confederacy, some national policies relevant to the Florida conflict should be noted. Particularly relevant is the Confederate Partisan Ranger Act of 1862, which attempted to regulate partisan warfare—and its subsequent revocation because partisan warfare, independent and close to home, was too attractive and drew men from the regular army. Did the act have any impact on Florida? The Lieber Code of 1863, which defined how Union troops were supposed to distinguish between legitimate partisans and outlaws, might also have been worth discussion, as some Florida battles combined units of the 2nd Florida, temporary outfits led by local politicians, and random rebel enthusiasts with rifles.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     Was the Lieber Code ever applied in Florida? But it is never fair to ask an author to write about issues outside of his primary goal in a book, and taken as it is, it is hard to imagine that anyone else will try to duplicate Waters’s exhaustive coverage of Florida’s war.

      Murder of 11-year-old Elizabeth DeBruicker

    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     On Friday, July 21, 1939, in Attica, Indiana, local newspaper
headlines speculated on the intentions of Adolf Hitler. The Fuhrer had assured
the world that the German people were "100% against going to war." Few believed
him, with good reason. Just two months later, Germany invaded Poland, starting
World War II.

     wrote that "at about noon, Peter DeBruicker arrived in
Attica…to deliver two of his young daughters to Attica School, where their 4-H
club was meeting. He planned to drive back into town later in the afternoon and
pick them up." Peter was described in the newspapers as a "Dutchman" who ran a
modest spread.

    The club meeting ended at 1:00, and an excited Elizabeth informed
her sister, Loretta, that she planned to go swimming at the Harrison Hills Country
Club pool, a few blocks away. Elizabeth told her sister and a friend, Lorraine
Ward, to meet her at the pool at 3:00. As the sun scorched the earth,
Elizabeth, a smart, pretty seventh grader who attended Logan Township School, walked
away.
   </span>
   <p/>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     At the time, the rural community of Attica had about 3,700
residents.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     When Elizabeth's sister and friend made it to the pool, they
found no sign of her. They asked around, but no one had seen the girl. Peter
arrived and quickly began searching for his daughter. The search soon spread
into town, but the child had vanished.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     Finally, as darkness fell, Peter reported the missing girl to
police.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     Early the next morning, searchers began combing the country
club and golf course. The
    </span>
    <i style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     Journal and Courier
    </i>
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     reported "their search of
the rolling golf greens was soon rewarded when [Ike] Rensville found
Elizabeth’s sewing basket and powder compact beneath a tree. Nearby was a
300-foot-long rainwater catch basin, and near the pond, [a] trio of searchers
found a mound of freshly turned earth. A mere six inches beneath the gravel
they found the child’s body.
    </span>
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;"/>
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     The belt of
her dress, used to strangle her, still was knotted tightly around her neck. Her
shoes were missing."
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     An autopsy confirmed investigators' worst fears: Elizabeth had been brutally raped as well as
strangled.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     The greenskeeper of the country club,
    </span>
    <b style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     Thomas Allen Boys
    </b>
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     ,
27, was brought in for questioning. His home lay directly on the route Elizabeth
would have taken from the school to the pool. Police knew he’d been convicted
of molesting a 9-year-old girl several years before, but surprisingly, had only
received a 6-month suspended sentence for the crime. (He had offered the child
a nickel to undress for him.) Boys had a wife and three sons.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     Lt. Paul Rule, commander of the West Lafayette State Police,
interrogated Boys. After many hours of questioning, the suspect broke.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     Rule made the following statement to reporters: "[Boys] told us he
saw the little girl walking across the sixth green at the golf course Friday
afternoon and that he called to her to walk across to the other side of the
course with him. They sat down on a hillside and he became familiar with her.
He became panicky and made a garrote from her belt and strangled her. After
that, he related, he carried her body down to a small pond and held her face
under the water until he was satisfied she had drowned. He said he then buried
her in the place where her body was found."
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     Boys denied raping Elizabeth but since the autopsy revealed she'd
been "criminally assaulted," no one believed his denial.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     Boys admitted he dug the shallow grave with his hands, and,
when one of Elizabeth's shoes fell off, he threw it in the pond. Searchers
located the shoe where he said it would be. Near the grave, they discovered the
sewing basket. In the basket, cops found sewing items (for her 4-H club
meeting), a bloodstained handkerchief, and Elizabeth’s "underclothing."
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     After searching Boys' home, investigators found bloody pants
and a shirt.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     During that era, lynchings were always a possibility in crimes
against children. As cops questioned the suspect, more than 300 people gathered
outside the Attica jail. To keep him safe, Lt. Rule transferred Boys to the Marion
County jail in Indianapolis, about eighty miles away.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     On March 12, 1940, Boys was being held in the Montgomery
County jail.
    </span>
    <i style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     The Capital Times
    </i>
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     reported: "Late yesterday, Harry
Anderson, 60-year-old day jailor, was taking Boys back to his second-floor cell
from the basement, where the prisoner had bathed. Suddenly, Anderson said, Boys
kicked him in the groin, beat him with a broomstick he had snatched up
somewhere, and, trampling him, ran downstairs and out the front door. The
spring lock had failed to catch."
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     He fled into a nearby back yard as eighty officers searched
for him. He stated he went to sleep, and when he awoke, asked the resident,
Louis Stanford, to call police. Within four hours, the escaped suspect was back
in jail.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     On May 1, 1940, Boys, after having pleaded not guilty by
reason of insanity, was convicted of the first-degree murder and rape of
Elizabeth DeBruicker. He escaped the death penalty, however, and was sentenced
to life in prison.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     In 1956, Boys applied for clemency, but was denied.

invaded the Confederate States of America, the two armies collided near a small

later called the Battle of Shiloh was unprecedented in the history of the
Americas. In two days of fighting, tens of thousands were killed or wounded.

     The Confederacy’s purpose in building a workable submarine was
a direct result of the Union blockade of New Orleans, Mobile and other ports.
The shutting down of Southern harbors had been one of the first actions taken
by Abraham Lincoln and his war machine. While in New Orleans, Horace Hunley and
others had begun a serious quest to build an underwater “fish” that could blow
up the blockaders.

     During 1862 and the early part of 1863, attempts to construct
a workable submarine had failed miserably. As boat after boat sank or capsized during
trials, resulting in the deaths of numerous crew members, the project faltered.
But as the war progressed and the South continued hemorrhaging its limited
manpower in battle after battle, the situation became dire. The charismatic

   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     In a test trial while still in Mobile, this underwater torpedo

those in the know.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     Constructed from iron boilerplate, the submarine was shaped
like a shark, 40 feet long and just wide and high enough to carry her cramped
crew. “The

     could dive by opening a valve and letting sea water
fill the ballast tank,” wrote Gerald Teaster. “A set of crude diving planes,
sticking out the side of the boat, was also provided for up and down motion. A
mercury manometer, or pressure gauge, was mounted inside to show the depth. Two
small hatches were installed on the top of the boat for getting in and out.
Each of these had a small glass viewing port.” The propeller in the back of the
submarine rotated inside a circular metal shroud that protected it from
snagging on nets or other debris. Eight hand-cranks were spaced so the crew
could sit along the length of the torpedo ship and drive the propeller shaft.

   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     On its final voyage, the shark-boat held seven crew members as
well as Captain Dixon. The crew, using the hand-cranks, was responsible for propelling
the ship. Dixon stood in the front of the boat with his head in the forward
hatch, looking out the glass window and guiding the crew. He also operated the
diving planes and was responsible for setting off the explosive.

     used an innovative lanyard system to detonate
the torpedo. The idea was to ram the spar torpedo into a target and then back
away, causing the torpedo to slip off the spar. A rope from the torpedo to the
submarine would spool out. Once the submarine was at a safe distance, the line
would tighten and detonate the warhead.” The shark-boat had to be up close and
personal to work effectively.

killing all its crew. The boat was raised and refurbished and new trial runs

The copper keg, filled with 135 pounds of black powder, detonated just below

      By Robert A. Waters
     </span>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     On November 17, 1954, Jeanette Earnest disappeared. She’d been waiting for her mother to pick her up at a Fort Worth, Texas washateria after school. But when Nadine Earnest arrived, Jeanette was gone.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     The hairs on Nadine's neck stood up. She knew immediately who had taken her daughter.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     A few months before Jeanette went missing, Nadine had developed strong suspicions about her brother-in-law, forty-eight-year-old
Thurman Priest. She abruptly moved her family's worshipping place from the Baptist Church they
attended to a nearby Methodist Church. It wasn’t because of doctrinal issues—it
was because Thurman, married to Nadine's sister, had started attending eleven-year-old Jeanette's Sunday School class. It seemed so weird that even the minister got involved, asking Priest to take part in one of the adult classes instead.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;"/>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium; line-height: 107%;">
     Married to Nadine’s sister, Priest worked as a bookkeeper for
a local airline company. Newspapers characterized him "as a strange little man." In his spare time, he'd begun coming over to the Earnest home to play with
Jeanette and her brothers and sisters. After it became obvious that Priest had developed a crush on the young girl, Nadine forcefully warned him to stay away.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium; line-height: 107%;">
     The concerned mother had even considered moving out of state to eliminate the problem.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium; line-height: 107%;">
     Now that Jeanette had vanished, Nadine called police and reported her daughter missing. She informed investigators about Priest, describing his obsession with Jeanette. Then she called her estranged husband and Jeanette's father, H. M. Earnest, who became so upset he had to be administered sedatives.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium; line-height: 107%;">
     Fort Worth Police Department officers began a frantic search for Priest. He had a head start of several hours and could be anywhere. But cops knew the danger and made the case a top priority. In addition to launching a manhunt locally, they contacted surrounding states asking that their lawmen "be on the lookout" for Priest.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium; line-height: 107%;">
     <br/>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium; line-height: 107%;">
     As he drove out of Fort Worth, Priest told Jeanette they were moving to Ohio. She asked if "Auntie" was coming. (Auntie was Priest's wife, Etta Mae.) Priest informed the child that when he found a job, Auntie would join them.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     After less than an hour on the road, Priest stopped at a motel in Irving, Texas, but spent only an hour there. No one knows what happened in that room because Priest never told.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     Their next stop was a tourist court called the Holiday Motel, in Baxter Springs, Kansas. Priest rented a cabin for one night. In a later interview, the manager, Mrs. Johnnie Page, told investigators a frightening story. She said Jeanette ran out of the cabin Tuesday afternoon, in obvious distress. Priest chased her down, shoved her into the car, and sped off. Later, a maid found bloodspots on the bathroom floor of the cabin, a small bloodstain on a towel, and an earring cops identified as Jeanette's. (Inexplicably, Page had not called police. With a phone call, Jeanette's life may have been saved.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     A few hours later, Priest stopped at a tourist court in Stanton, Missouri. There he registered the two as man and wife. At about 6:00 A.M. Wednesday morning, they left.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     Jeanette was never seen alive again.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     Mount Vernon, Missouri police arrested Priest after he stopped at a motel and called his wife. Etta Mae spoke to the manager and asked if a little girl was with Priest. When the manager responded that Thurman was the only person in his car, Etta Mae asked her to call police.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: georgia;">
     <span style="font-size: medium;">
      Detectives interviewed the suspect. At first, he claimed he didn't remember what happened to Jeanette. But when one of the interrogators mentioned that she was a "beautiful girl," it was like turning on a faucet. He turned "dreamy-eyed" and assured the detective he was right.
     </span>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     The
     <i>
      Fort Worth Star-Telegram
     </i>
     reported Priest "admitted Sunday he killed his 11-year-old niece, Jeanette Earnest, and led officers to a spot four miles east of [Lebanon, Missouri] where he had hidden the body."

    The reporter wrote that "the child's fully clothed, unburied body was found in a heavy oak grove about three hundred yards off U. S. Highway 66 and almost eight miles from where the girl's blouse was found Wednesday. She had been shot once in the right temple with a .32 automatic."
   </span>
   <p/>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     During the police interview, Priest told cops where they could find the gun used to murder Jeanette. The
     <i>
      Star-Telegram
     </i>
     reported the FBI "identified a .32 automatic pistol and an empty cartridge found near the girl's body as having microscopic marks which showed it had been fired in the chamber of the pistol."
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     The community of Fort Worth reeled in horror. Her classmates had prayed en mass for Jeanette's safe return at school on Tuesday. Her father was still bed-ridden. But Nadine remained stoic in public. Her focus was on bringing Priest to justice.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: georgia;">
     <span style="font-size: medium;">
      Priest claimed he and Jeanette were in love. "The last two years," he said, "I [was] always so lonesome and depressed when [Jeanette] wasn't with me. I just couldn't stand it. I was afraid the family was going to take the girl away from me. If I couldn't have her, no one could."
     </span>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     He claimed he loved her like a father and had never "raped" her. But Dr. Paul Jenkins, who performed the autopsy, stated he "could not determine whether she had been criminally assaulted. [He] also could not definitely show that she hadn't been."
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     On April 29, 1955, Priest was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.

   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     On July 6, 1960, Thurman Priest died of a heart attack while still in a Missouri prison.

   <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
    In his confessions, Priest alleged that Jeanette "loved" him. That is doubtful. When she was younger, she may have been flattered by his attentions as they played children's games, but later she told her mother she viewed him as a nuisance. She also said she was embarrassed when he began attending Sunday School with her.
   </span>
   <p/>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     After abducting Jeanette, it's likely he made sexual advances toward her. At the cabin in Baxter Springs, he almost certainly attempted to molest the child. She likely fought back and tried to escape. In addition to the constant threat of sexual assault, Jeanette likely felt uncomfortable spending hours and hours alone in a car with Priest.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">
     Perhaps Nadine said it best: "I think he was mad at her because she was crying and wanted to go home. He decided that if he couldn't have her he didn't want anyone else to have her and decided to kill her."

     Compilation: Female Victims Fighting Back--Stories from my Blog

   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     I started my blog in 2008. Over the years, I’ve published
more than 700 stories. Most deal with crime, although I also enjoy writing
about the Civil War, historical events, archaeological discoveries, my family’s genealogy, etc. I also occasionally write book reviews, but only about books I enjoy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     One of my major interests concerns citizens using guns in self-defense. As
a storyteller, I seldom engage in political discussions. I feel that a dramatized account of what occurred is more effective than a long political
lecture. Of the 700 posts, about 100 recount true, documented stories of citizens defending themselves (or others) with
firearms.

surveillance video.

   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     The 36-year-old Chinese woman quickly sent the three panicked
home invaders fleeing. Cameras show Chen raining bullets on the surprised trio
as she races out of her bedroom dressed in pajamas.

     Daily Mail
    </i>
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     reported "incredible footage has been released showing the moment a Georgia woman rushed out of the bed in the
middle of the night and opened fire at three armed men who broke into her
house, killing one. The surveillance footage, released by the Gwinnett County [Georgia]
Police Department, shows the intruders—all of whom are carrying guns—bursting
through the front door and rummaging the house…"
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     Chen explained her actions to a reporter. "I didn’t have any
choice," she said, "so I had to take out the gun I’d hid there. Then I loaded
my pistol and walked out of my bedroom. I shot at the invaders when I saw them.
One of them fled quickly, and another one ran away from the front door. Then I
shot again. The one inside my house broke the glass on the back door and ran
away.
    </span>
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     I didn’t feel scared at the moment and all I thought about
was how to deal with the situation."

     , 28, lying in
the driveway of the home. "Police took off the burglar’s clothes," Chen said, "and attempted to resuscitate him for about 15 to 20 minutes and they told me
they had failed to save him." Investigators later reported he had died from a bullet wound to his "torso."
    </span>

    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;"/>
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     The third suspect has not yet been apprehended.

   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     Cpl. Deon Washington of the Gwinnett County Police Department told
reporters the resident acted appropriately. "She exercised her right to defend
her livelihood and property," he said.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     But there's a back-story here, one few people know.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     Many robbers target Chinese business owners because it’s rumored they keep lots of cash in their homes. Police speculated the invaders in
Gwinnett County specifically targeted Chen for that reason. Once inside,
the robbers began searching for cash and valuables. This
gave Chen the opportunity to wake up and get her firearm.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     Chen surprised the thieves with a blitz attack, emptying the
magazine in her semiautomatic handgun. The video shows each robber fleeing in different directions.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     Investigators released the video in order to identify the two surviving invaders.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     Why Little was walking the streets is another back story. Born
in 1982, he committed a series of violent crimes in 1997 when he was just 15 years
old. The courts convicted Little of the following: kidnapping, hijacking a motor vehicle,
rape, aggravated sodomy, armed robbery, aggravated assault, and possession of a
firearm during a crime. He received sentences for each conviction, totaling 136
years. It’s probable he was released because of his age when he committed the
crimes. The question remains: should anyone, even a teenager, be released early after committing all these violent crimes?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     He had been on the streets for only six months before encountering Chen.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     Little was convicted of the following offenses against Chen: burglary,
aggravated assault, home invasion 1

    <sup style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">
     st
    </sup>
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     degree, possession of a
firearm by a convicted felon, armed robbery, and murder. He is currently serving out his sentence. According to the Georgia Department of Corrections, Little's "maximum release date is March 28, 2043."
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     Does that mean he can be released earlier than 2043?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;">
     The third intruder has never been caught. (See picture below.) If you recognize him, please call the Gwinnett County Police Department at 770-513-5000.
